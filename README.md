# 🚀 Job Genie - One Click Job Search Tool

**Job Genie** uses an intelligent job search agent powered by **CrewAI** to automate the process of finding job listings on company career pages. The main motive of Job Genie is to save time to check the job listings of companies.

### 🌟 How It Works
- Users select the **URL of the company** they are interested in.  
- They specify a **list of job roles** they want to search for.  
- The agent crawls the page, **extracts relevant job details**, and matches them with the user's preferences.  
- The results are returned via a **FastAPI endpoint**, making it easy to quickly discover and apply for relevant job openings.
